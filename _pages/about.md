I have a professional degree in Architecture, specialized in computational design with experience in the industry and the academia. I am currently a M.S. in Design Computation graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My interest focuses on data-driven methods for architecture and design in general. I have the skills and experience to develop architectural projects at all stages, integrating specialized skills in design scripting, parametric modeling, custom tool, development, and data analytics.
